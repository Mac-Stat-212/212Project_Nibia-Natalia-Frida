## Research Questions

- How has tree cover changed across Brazil from 2000 to 2023 at the state and municipality levels?
- How does  tree cover loss vary annually across selected Brazilian states?
- What associations, if any, exist between the political leaning of the national administration and annual tree cover loss in Brazil?

## Deliverable
Our planned digital artifact is a Shiny App designed to explore the relationship between tree cover loss and political leanings in Brazil.
The app features three main interactive visualizations.

The first tab displays a map of Brazil showing changes in tree cover extent from 2000 to 2020, showing the percentage of tree cover per municipality and the relative change in tree cover extent from 2000 to 2020.
Users can select the year to observe the trends across three time periods: 2000, 2010 and 2020. 

The second tab presents annual tree cover loss for each state.
Users can select the state to visualize annual tree cover loss from 2001 to 2023, smoothed using a 3-year rolling average.

The third tab shows national annual tree cover loss over time, with colored rectangles indicating the political leaning of each administration.
This tab helps contextualize environmental changes alongside shifts in governance.

Each tab includes explanatory text that walks the  users through each of the visualizations and provides the necessary context.
